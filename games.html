            <h3>I have made many games in my own time to better at programming and game development some of them might be bad because i just decided to throw something together and to see if i could make the gameplay mechanic! and all my games(that i have published) can be found on me itch.io page <a href="https://finthefinn.itch.io">here!</a></h3><br>
            <h3>and over here i will show you some of my best games, well atleast in my mind...</h3>

            <h1><a href="https://finthefinn.itch.io/new-pong">NEW PONG</a></h1><br>
            <h3>New pong is the second game i have ever made using unity! The game actually started as a school summer project where we had to spend at minimum 70h making a game and i spent around 30h... so i kinda failed the project even tho i thought that the game would have been big enought for the 70h minimum. Well anyways lets talk about the gameplay now! This game is like pong exept you can rotate you paddle and not only that but you can change pretty much everything! you can change the player paddle sizes or speed you can give the ball a certain amount of gravity you can even add obsticles in the way or even change the ball into a cube or triangle and you can of course customize all the colors in the game and the options will automatically save so if you would exit the game and come back the settings would stay the same!</h3>

            <h1><a href="https://finthefinn.itch.io/just-another-tower-defense-game">JUST ANOTHER TOWER DEFENCE GAME</a></h1><br>
            <h3>Just another tower defense game is well just like the title says just another tower defence game where you have different towers that you can place down, upgrade and sell for a little bit of money, but the special thing about this game is that the waves are randomly generated and some waves will have an immunity to some towers so you better buy more than just one type of tower!</h3>

            <h3>Void Of Infinited Dangers or VOID for short is a basic roguelike where you have to fight waves of enemies and after you have beaten a wave you and the enemies will get a random upgrade, and if you are interested i made the random map generation using cellular automata and marching squares using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eZgMK_DT5_biRkWXftAOf9">this tutorial!</a></h3>
